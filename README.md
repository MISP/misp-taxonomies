# MISP Taxonomies

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MISP/misp-taxonomies.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MISP/misp-taxonomies)

MISP Taxonomies is a set of common classification libraries to tag, classify and organise information. Taxonomy allows to express the same vocabulary among a distributed set of users and organisations.

Taxonomies that can be used in [MISP](https://github.com/MISP/MISP) (2.4) and other information sharing tool and expressed in Machine Tags (Triple Tags). A machine tag is composed of a namespace (MUST), a predicate (MUST) and an (OPTIONAL) value. Machine tags are often called triple tag due to their format.

![Overview of the MISP taxonomies](tools/docs/images/taxonomy-explanation.png)

The following taxonomies can be used in MISP (as local or distributed tags) or in other tools and software willing to share common taxonomies among security information sharing tools.

Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing is a format created by the [VERIS community](http://veriscommunity.net/).

# Reserved Taxonomy

The following taxonomy namespaces are reserved and used internally to MISP.

- [galaxy](./galaxy/) mapping taxonomy with cluster:element:"value".

# Documentation

A documentation of the taxonomies is [generated automatically](https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies/blob/master/tools/machinetag.py) from the taxonomies description and available in [PDF](https://www.misp.software/taxonomies.pdf) and [HTML](https://www.misp.software/taxonomies.html).

# How to contribute your taxonomy?

It is quite easy. Create a JSON file describing your taxonomy as triple tags (e.g. check an existing one like [Admiralty Scale](./admiralty-scale)), create a directory matching your name space, put your machinetag file in the directory and pull your request. That's it. Everyone can benefit from your taxonomy and can be automatically enabled in information sharing tools like [MISP](https://www.github.com/MISP/MISP).

For more information, "[Information Sharing and Taxonomies Practical Classification of Threat Indicators using MISP](https://www.circl.lu/assets/files/misp-training/3.2-MISP-Taxonomy-Tagging.pdf)" presentation given to the last MISP training in Luxembourg.

# How to add your private taxonomy to MISP

~~~~shell
$ cd /var/www/MISP/app/files/taxonomies/
$ mkdir privatetaxonomy
$ cd privatetaxonomy
$ vi machinetag.json
~~~~

Create a JSON file describing your taxonomy as triple tags.

Once you are happy with your file go to MISP Web GUI taxonomies/index and update the taxonomies, the newly created taxonomy should be visible, now you need to activate the tags within your taxonomy.

# MISP Taxonomies

## Tools

[machinetag.py](./tools/machinetag.py) is a parsing tool to dump taxonomies expressed in Machine Tags (Triple Tags) and list all valid tags from a specific taxonomy.

~~~~shell
% cd tools
% python machinetag.py
        admiralty-scale:source-reliability="a"
        admiralty-scale:source-reliability="b"
        admiralty-scale:source-reliability="c"
        admiralty-scale:source-reliability="d"
        admiralty-scale:source-reliability="e"
        admiralty-scale:source-reliability="f"
        admiralty-scale:information-credibility="1"
        admiralty-scale:information-credibility="2"
        admiralty-scale:information-credibility="3"
        admiralty-scale:information-credibility="4"
