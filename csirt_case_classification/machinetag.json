  "description": "It is critical that the CSIRT provide consistent and timely response to the customer, and that sensitive information is handled appropriately.  This document provides the guidelines needed for CSIRT Incident Managers (IM) to classify the case category, criticality level, and sensitivity level for each CSIRT case.  This information will be entered into the Incident Tracking System (ITS) when a case is created.  Consistent case classification is required for the CSIRT to provide accurate reporting to management on a regular basis.  In addition, the classifications will provide CSIRT IM’s with proper case handling procedures and will form the basis of SLA’s between the CSIRT and other Company departments.",
