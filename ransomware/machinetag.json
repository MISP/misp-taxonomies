However, the victim had to have been running a specific version of Windows XP and be fortunate enough that the related address space in memory has not been reallocated to another process. In another example, it is theoretically possible to reverse WannaCry encryption by exploiting a flaw in the pseudo-random-number-generator (PRNG) in an unpatched Windows XP system that reveals keys generated in the past. Naturally, these specialized conditions are not true for most victims."
