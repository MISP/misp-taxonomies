This priority assignment drives NCCIC urgency, pre-approved incident response offerings, reporting requirements, and recommendations for leadership escalation. Generally, incident priority distribution should follow a similar pattern to the graph below. Based on https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/cisa-national-cyber-incident-scoring-system-nciss.
