This action heavily relies on your capability to store logs for a reasonable amount of time and have them accessible for searching. Typically, this type of action is applied against security information and event management (SIEM) or stored network data. The goal is to determine whether you have seen a specific indicator in the past."

          "expanded": "The passive action is setting up detection rules of an indicator for future traffic. These actions are most often executed via an intrusion detection system (IDS) or a specific logging rule on your firewall or application. It can also be configured as an alert in a SIEM when a specific condition is triggered."

This tactic allows you to catch up during an incident response process, but you have to consider that the attackers may eventually succeed in achieving their objectives. Throttling bandwidth is one way to degrade an intrusion."

          "expanded": "Deception allows you to learn more about the intentions of the attacker by making them think the action was successful. One way to do this is to put a honeypot in place and redirect the traffic, based on an indicator, towards the honeypot."
