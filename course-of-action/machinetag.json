          "expanded": "The discover action is a 'historical look at the data'. This action heavily relies on your capability to store logs for a reasonable amount of time and have them accessible for searching. Typically, this type of action is applied against security information and event management (SIEM) or stored network data. The goal is to determine whether you have seen a specific indicator in the past."

          "expanded": "The passive action is setting up detection rules of an indicator for future traffic. These actions are most often executed via an intrusion detection system (IDS) or a specific logging rule on your firewall or application. It can also be configured as an alert in a SIEM when a specific condition is triggered."

          "expanded": "Degrading will not immediately fail an event, but it will slow down the further actions of the attacker. This tactic allows you to catch up during an incident response process, but you have to consider that the attackers may eventually succeed in achieving their objectives. Throttling bandwidth is one way to degrade an intrusion."

          "expanded": "The destroy action is rarely for 'usual' defenders, as this is an offensive action against the attacker. These actions, including physical destructive actions and arresting the attackers, are usually left to law enforcement agencies."
